# Caribou density and vegetation change

## Project summary

Rapid climate warming has contributed to significant changes in Arctic and boreal vegetation over the past half century. Changes in vegetation can impact wildlife by altering habitat and forage availability, which can affect behavior and range use. However, animals can also influence vegetation through foraging and trampling and therefore play an important role in determining ecosystem responses to climate change. As wildlife populations grow, density-dependent processes can prompt range expansion or shifts. One mechanism for this is density-dependent forage reduction, which can contribute to nutritional stress and population declines, and can also alter vegetation change trajectories. We assessed the range characteristics of a migratory caribou (*Rangifer tarandus*) herd in east-central Alaska and west-central Yukon Territory as it grew (1992-2017) then declined (2017-2020). Furthermore, we analyzed the correlation between caribou relative spatial density and vegetation change over this period using remotely-sensed models of plant functional type cover.
